## If you wanna test :P

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
# then
yarn dev
```
## Who is this for?
Basically it's my portfolio where I tried to put some of the skills I am master at.

I would love to cover Redux, some Axios calls and more getServerSide stuff
but I cant see where I would put it here in such a small project.

One of the reasons was also to create something from scratch since last time I did something
similar was 3 years ago:P
